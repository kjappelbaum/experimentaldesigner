# experimentaldesigner 

This is not a replacement for the sycofinder by LSMO. This is just my hobby project to play around with making apps with Dash and learning about experimental designs.

The idea is to have a simple web app that can generate a variety of different experimental designs from simple inputs and then generate a table with the experimental design matrix.
