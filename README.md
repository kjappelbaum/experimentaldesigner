# experimentaldesigner

This is not a replacement for the [sycofinder by LSMO](https://github.com/ltalirz/sycofinder). Indeed, the app rather takes many parts from the sycofinder and builds ontop.  
This is just my hobby project to play around with making apps with Dash and learning about experimental designs, eventually helping experimentalists to gain more information from their experiments. 

The idea is to have a simple web app that can generate a variety of different experimental designs from simple inputs and then generate a table with the experimental design matrix.

Currently [deployed on Heroku](https://experimentaldesigner.herokuapp.com) for tests.

## ToDo

- [ ] Re-introduce weights (?)
- [ ] Give estimate of required number of samples (?)
