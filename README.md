# experimentaldesigner 

This is not a replacement for the sycofinder by LSMO. This is just my hobby project to play around with making apps with Dash and learning about experimental designs.

The idea is to have a simple web app that can generate a variety of different experimental designs from simple inputs and then generate a table with the experimental design matrix. 

Currently [deployed on Heroku](https://experimentaldesigner.herokuapp.com) for tests. 

## ToDo

- [ ] Re-introduce weights (?)
- [ ] Give estimate of required number of samples (?)
